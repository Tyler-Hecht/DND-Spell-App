# DND Spell App

This is a webapp that displays spells for a given DND class\
The spells can be searched by name and filtered by level, casting time, etc.\
Clicking on a spell shows its description

Currently, three classes and no subclasses are supported\
More features will be added soon

## Running

1. Install Python and pip
2. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the app by running the .bat file or entering `flask --app app run --port=5000 --host=0.0.0.0` in the terminal

The steps described above are meant for Windows, but similar steps can be followed for Mac
